# Dashboard

`Dashboard` renders at `GET {base_path}` — it's independent of any one
`ModelAdmin`, just a titled collection of `Widget`s.

```python
from polyadmin.core.dashboard import Dashboard
from polyadmin.core.widget import Metric, Donut, Table

dashboard = Dashboard(title="Overview", widgets=[
    Metric("Users", get_value=lambda: len(users.list())),
    Donut("Users by status", get_series=lambda: [
        ("Active", sum(1 for u in users.list() if u.is_active)),
        ("Inactive", sum(1 for u in users.list() if not u.is_active)),
    ]),
])
admin = Admin(model_admins=[...], dashboard=dashboard)
```

Every widget computes its own data lazily (`get_value`/`get_series`/
`get_rows`/`get_entries` callables) — nothing is computed until the
dashboard route actually renders, so a widget backed by a slow query
only pays that cost on page load, not at `Dashboard` construction time.

## How tall a card gets

The dashboard is a grid, and a grid stretches every card in a row to
match the tallest one. So a card's content area is bounded rather than
free to grow: past about 320px it scrolls inside its own card, with the
same themed scrollbar the rest of the admin uses. A `Table` of two
hundred rows leaves the cards beside it exactly where they were.

It scrolls in one direction only. A card is a fixed column of the grid,
so anything wider than it is a widget that has to wrap, not a sideways
scrollbar for the reader to drag — `widgets/table.html` wraps its cells
(and breaks a long unbroken value) rather than holding them on one
line.

This applies to a custom widget's template too — it renders inside that
box and needs no overflow container of its own. A second scroller
nested in there shows a second scrollbar, and content that bleeds past
the box's edge, as a negative margin does, is clipped.

## Built-in widget types

| Widget | Shows | Constructor |
|---|---|---|
| Metric | A single headline number | `Metric(title, get_value=...)` |
| Stat | A headline number *and* its change vs. the previous period | `Stat(title, get_stat=...)` → `(value, delta)` |
| Progress | A value against a target, as a bar | `Progress(title, get_data=...)` → `(value, target)` |
| Chart | Labeled values as horizontal CSS bars | `Chart(title, get_series=...)` → `[(label, value), ...]` |
| Donut | A share-of-total breakdown, as an SVG ring + legend | `Donut(title, get_series=...)` → `[(label, value), ...]` |
| Table | Small tabular data | `Table(title, columns=[...], get_rows=...)` |
| Activity | A recent-activity feed (short text entries) | `Activity(title, get_entries=...)` |
| Timeline | Dated events on a rail — time, title, description | `Timeline(title, get_entries=...)` → `[(time, title, description), ...]` |
| Tabs | Several widgets in one card, one visible at a time | `Tabs(title, panels=[(label, widget), ...])` |

`Chart` and `Donut` are deliberately dependency-free — no JS charting
library is bundled (matching the CDN-only frontend approach), so
`Chart` renders as plain CSS width-percentage bars and `Donut` as a
hand-built SVG ring (the classic `stroke-dasharray`-on-a-circumference-
100-circle technique), not a real charting library's canvas/SVG
output. `Donut` cycles through a 6-color qualitative palette
(blue/violet/teal/amber/rose/cyan, deliberately distinct from the
toast component's green/orange/red success/warning/danger colors so a
slice is never mistaken for a status indicator); past 6 series entries
it wraps and repeats.

`Stat`, `Timeline` and `Tabs` are adapted from Flowbite's
admin-dashboard layout (its "Sales this week", "Latest Activity" and
"Statistics this month" cards respectively), restyled to the same
shadcn/ui tokens as the rest of the framework, so a custom widget
inherits the active theme (and dark mode) for free.

`Stat`'s delta is the *signed* percentage change, so `-4.2` means
"down 4.2%". The widget draws up in green and down in red, matching
the success/danger colors of the toast component, with an arrow
carrying the same meaning for anyone who can't separate the two hues.
That assumes up is good — for a metric where it isn't, such as an
error rate, negate the delta and say so in the title.

## Tabs: widgets inside widgets

`Tabs` is a *container*: it holds no data of its own, and each panel
is an ordinary widget rendered exactly as it would be at the top
level.

```python
Tabs("User breakdown", panels=[
    ("By status", Donut("Users by status", get_series=...)),
    ("By organization", Donut("Users by organization", get_series=...)),
])
```

Two things worth knowing:

- **Every panel is computed and rendered on page load**, not on first
  click — switching tabs is pure client-side Alpine, with no round
  trip, so a panel backed by a slow query costs the same whether or
  not anyone opens it. Put an expensive breakdown in its own widget
  rather than a tab if you don't want to pay for it every render.
- **A panel widget's own title isn't shown** — the tab label takes its
  place, and only the container's title appears in the card header.

With Alpine still loading (or not running at all), the first panel
stays visible and the rest stay hidden, so the card degrades to its
default tab rather than to everything-at-once.

Nesting happens inside `tabs.html`, which renders each panel through
the same `{% include widget.template %}` the dashboard uses for a
top-level widget — so a container is just a widget whose template
happens to include others.

Every widget accepts `size="lg"` to span the full grid width instead of
one column, and an optional `permission=`: a widget naming a permission
is simply omitted (not shown-disabled) if the `Authorizer` denies it
for the current principal — see [`permissions.md`](permissions.md).

## Custom widgets

You can add your own widget type without a framework change. Subclass
`Widget`, set `template` to your own `.html` file (placed under one of
the `template_dirs` passed to `create_router`), and implement
`get_data()` — `{% include widget.template %}` resolves it through
Jinja2's normal loader search path, same as any other override.

```python
class RecentSignupsWidget(Widget):
    template = "widgets/recent-signups.html"

    def get_data(self):
        return {"rows": recent_signups()}
```

```jinja
{# templates/widgets/recent-signups.html #}
<!-- your markup, using whatever get_data() returned -->
```

```python
create_router(admin, base_path="/admin", template_dirs=["templates"])
```

The framework's own widget templates (`Metric`, `Stat`, `Progress`,
`Chart`, `Donut`, `Table`, `Activity`, `Timeline`, `Tabs`) are checked
first, so a custom `template` value only needs to avoid colliding with
`admin/widgets/*.html` — see [`templates.md`](templates.md) for the
full resolution order shared with per-resource overrides.
