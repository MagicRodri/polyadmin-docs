# Exports

`GET /{slug}/export/{format}` streams the resource's `list_display`
columns as a downloadable file, gated by its own `.export` permission
(independent of `.view` — a principal can be allowed to browse a
resource without being allowed to export it, or vice versa).

## It's the same data you're looking at

The export route runs the exact same query pipeline the list view
does — search, every active filter, and ordering, all read from the
request's query string — before handing the result to the exporter.
Concretely: the "Export CSV" link rendered on the list page carries
the current search/filter/sort along in its own query string, so
exporting after searching/filtering exports what's on screen, not the
whole table. There's no separate export-specific query API to keep in
sync with the list view's.

## Formats

| Format | Exporter |
|---|---|
| CSV | `CSVExporter` |
| XLSX | `XLSXExporter`, via `openpyxl` (optional dependency: `polyadmin[export-xlsx]`) |

CSV is genuinely streamed row-by-row to the HTTP response — the
exporter never holds more than one row in memory, so export size is
bounded by how long you're willing to keep the connection open, not by
RAM. XLSX is a partial exception: the zip container format has to be
finalized before any bytes go out, so unlike CSV it's buffered once
before sending, not chunked to the client as it's generated
(`openpyxl`'s write-only mode at least avoids materializing a row
*object* per row along the way). Keep XLSX exports to a reasonable row
count for that reason; CSV doesn't have this limit.

XLSX cells keep their native type — a number stays a number, a boolean
stays a boolean.

## Cell values

A plain field exports its value as-is. A foreign-key/one-to-one field
exports its *target's* display label (whatever `Relation.display_field`
points at), not a raw object repr; a many-to-many field exports a
comma-joined list of its related objects' display labels. This mirrors
how the same relation renders in the list/detail views, so an export
column and its on-screen equivalent always agree.

## Adding a custom format

```python
create_router(..., exporters=(CSVExporter(), XLSXExporter(), MyExporter()))
```

Any `Exporter` subclass implementing `format`, `content_type`,
`file_extension()`, and `stream(admin, model_admin, objects, columns,
header=None)` gets its own `/export/{format}` route registered
automatically, one per resource.

**Breaking change for custom exporters:** the export route now always
calls `stream(..., header=...)` with `header` as a keyword argument, so
an `Exporter` subclass written against the old four-argument
`stream(admin, model_admin, objects, columns)` fails with a `TypeError`
until it accepts `header` (defaulting it to `None` is enough).

`header` carries the already-translated column headers (falling back to
each field's own `label` when a custom exporter doesn't receive one).
The handler computes it *before* streaming starts, not inside the
generator: `StreamingResponse` only iterates the generator after the
route wrapper has reset the request's locale context variable, so a
translation attempted from inside `stream` itself would silently fall
back to English. A custom `Exporter` translating anything else of its
own has to do the same — read `gettext`/`get_locale()` before
returning its generator, not from within it. See
[`i18n.md`](i18n.md#in-code).
