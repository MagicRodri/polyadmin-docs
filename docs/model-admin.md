# ModelAdmin

`ModelAdmin` is the abstraction you actually write: one subclass per
resource, declaring how it should be administered and how to read/
write it. This is the reference for that contract — identity, fields,
the CRUD lifecycle, search/filter/ordering, relations, and Actions.

## Declaring one

Class attributes plus `Field` instances:

```python
from polyadmin import ModelAdmin, EmailField, BooleanField
from polyadmin.core.field import ForeignKeyField
from polyadmin.core.relation import Relation

class UserAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    model = User
    list_display = ("id", "email", "is_active", "organization")
    form_fields = ("email", "is_active", "organization")
    search_fields = ("email",)
    fields = (
        EmailField("email", required=True),
        BooleanField("is_active", default=True),
        ForeignKeyField("organization", relation=Relation(
            "organization", target="organizations", display_field="name",
        )),
    )

    def get_queryset(self):
        return self.repository.list()

    def get_object(self, pk):
        return self.repository.get(int(pk))

    def create(self, data):
        return self.repository.create(**data)

    def update(self, obj, data):
        return self.repository.update(obj, **data)

    def delete(self, obj):
        self.repository.delete(obj)
```

## Identity

- `slug` — the URL segment (`/admin/{slug}`); defaults to the
  lowercased, pluralized model name (`User` → `users`).
- `get_verbose_name()` — the human-readable name shown in the sidebar,
  breadcrumbs, and page titles; defaults to the model name as declared.
- `get_pk(obj)` — the primary key used to build this object's URL;
  defaults to reading an `id` attribute.
- `category` — optional sidebar grouping; ModelAdmins (and custom
  `AdminPage`s) sharing a category collapse into one collapsible
  accordion section, in first-registration-appearance order. Unset
  (`None`) keeps a flat top-level nav link. Also prepended to the
  breadcrumb trail when set. See
  [`routing.md`](routing.md#sidebar-categories).
- `icon` — the sidebar-nav icon shown next to this ModelAdmin's own
  link, flat or nested inside a category's accordion; defaults to
  `"collection"`. See [`routing.md`](routing.md#sidebar-categories).

## Fields

A field's `name` must match an attribute on your model object. Every
field the resource uses anywhere (`list_display`, `form_fields`,
`search_fields`) needs a `Field` declaration; a plain untyped `Field` is
filled in automatically for any name without one, so declaring one
explicitly is only required when you need type-specific behavior
(validation, a `<select>` of choices, a relation).

Built-in field types: `StringField`, `TextField`, `IntegerField`,
`DecimalField`, `BooleanField`, `DateField`, `DateTimeField`,
`EmailField`, `URLField`, `UUIDField`, `EnumField`, `JSONField`,
`PasswordField`, `ForeignKeyField`, `OneToOneField`, `ManyToManyField`.

Common keyword arguments: `required=`, `readonly=`, `disabled=`,
`default=`, `help_text=`, `placeholder=`, `choices=`, `relation=`.

## Default ordering

Without one, rows arrive in whatever order the data source returned —
which for a dict-backed store is not even stable between two requests.
Declare a default and the list has a defined order until the user sorts
it themselves:

```python
ordering = "-created_at"   # "-" for descending, like ?sort=
```

An explicit `?sort=` from the user always wins. The default is resolved
into the request before the query runs, so a `list_page` implementation
is told about it too rather than having to know the ModelAdmin's own
configuration.

## Acting on more than one page

A bulk action normally receives the rows the user ticked, which can only
ever be rows on the current page. When a whole page is selected the
table offers **"Select all N matching"**, which posts the current
search/filters instead of a pk list; the framework then resolves that
same query server-side and hands the action every matching record.

Nothing is needed to enable it. Two things are worth knowing when
writing an action: it may now receive far more objects than a page's
worth, and the set is exactly what the user was looking at — filters
included, pagination excluded.

## Scaling the list: resolving the query yourself

By default `get_queryset` returns **everything**, and the framework
applies search, filters, ordering and pagination in memory over that
result. That is the right trade for a small collection and the reason
getting started needs one method — but it means page 40 of a million
rows costs the same as page 1, and filters make it worse rather than
better, since they run after the whole set has been loaded.

A ModelAdmin backed by a real data source can take over the whole query
by defining one optional method:

```python
def list_page(self, list_request):
    offset, limit = list_request.window()   # limit 0 means "no limit"
    # ... one query: WHERE from list_request.search/.filters,
    #     ORDER BY from list_request.ordering, LIMIT/OFFSET from the window
    return rows, total
```

Return the rows for the requested window, and the **total matching rows
before it** — that count is what pagination displays.

Three things are worth knowing:

- **It is all-or-nothing.** When this method exists the framework
  applies nothing further: it cannot tell what you already did, and
  re-applying would filter twice. Honour every part of the request, or
  the UI will show controls that do nothing.
- **It serves every list query, not just the list page.** Both exports,
  the autocomplete lookup and non-autocomplete relation option lists all
  go through it. They are distinguished purely by the window: the list
  view asks for one page, the lookup for a capped page, and an export
  or an option list sets `unlimited`, which yields a limit of 0. If you
  ignore the window, an export still works but the autocomplete will
  return your whole table.
- **`get_queryset` is not called at all** for such an admin. It can stay
  as-is for other callers, or become a stub.

Not defining it changes nothing: the in-memory path is unchanged.

## Grouping the form: fieldsets

By default a form is one flat column in `form_fields` order. Past about
eight fields that stops being readable, so fields can be grouped into
titled sections — Django's `fieldsets`:

```python
fieldsets = [
    Fieldset(fields=["email", "is_active"]),
    Fieldset(title="Membership", description="Where this user belongs.",
             fields=["plan", "organization"]),
    Fieldset(title="Advanced", fields=["api_key"], collapsed=True),
]
```

Three rules are worth knowing:

- **Declaring fieldsets replaces the flat field list.** The groups *are*
  the form's fields, in the order given, so `get_form_fields()` reports
  the flattened result and the handler parses exactly what was rendered.
  `form_fields` is ignored once fieldsets are set — one source of truth,
  not two.
- **A group with no title renders bare** — no header, no border. That is
  what makes the default case (no fieldsets declared, one implicit
  unnamed group) identical to the flat form, and it lets you keep a few
  lead fields ungrouped above the titled sections.
- **A titled group is always collapsible.** `collapsed` only decides
  whether it *starts* closed; the reader can always open it.

## Read-only fields

A field can be shown on the form as a value rather than a control:

```python
readonly_fields = ["created_at"]
```

**This is enforced, not just presented.** The field renders with no
input, and the handler skips the name when reading the posted form — so
a crafted POST naming it cannot write it. (A `required` read-only field
is also excluded from validation, since the form never sends it.)

For the common "editable when created, frozen afterwards" case, override
the resolver instead of the list — it receives the object being edited,
and `None` when creating:

```python
def get_readonly_fields(self, obj=None):
    return [] if obj is None else ["email"]
```

Note this is a different thing from a `Field`'s own `readonly` option,
which marks a native input `readonly` but still posts its value.

## The CRUD lifecycle

Five hooks, all of which you implement against your own storage — core
never issues a database query:

| Hook | Called for |
|---|---|
| `get_queryset()` | list view, before search/filter/order/paginate |
| `get_object(pk)` | detail, edit, delete, and Action target resolution |
| `create(data)` | POST create, after validation passes |
| `update(obj, data)` | POST edit, after validation passes |
| `delete(obj)` | POST/DELETE delete |

Any of these five, plus `list_page`, may be `async def` instead of a plain
function -- useful for a ModelAdmin backed by an async HTTP client. The
FastAPI adapter awaits whichever ones are coroutine functions and calls the
rest directly, so a ModelAdmin may mix sync and async hooks freely. This
holds on every path, including a ModelAdmin used as a relation target
(`ForeignKeyField`, `ManyToManyField`, `autocomplete_fields`, relation
filters) or as an `Inline` child.

`data` is a `dict[str, Any]` keyed by field name, already coerced to
each field's Python type (an `IntegerField` submission arrives as `int`,
a `BooleanField` as `bool`, and so on).

## Validation

`validate(data)` runs every `form_fields` field's own validators
(required-ness first, then any custom `validators=`) and returns a
`dict[str, list[str]]` of field name → error messages, already
translated into the request's locale. A non-empty result re-renders
the form with those errors instead of calling `create`/`update` —
those are only ever called with data that already passed validation.

A field validator is a plain callable taking the value and raising
`ValueError` on a bad one; its message is translated the same way the
built-in required-field message is — a static English message
(`raise ValueError("Enter a valid number.")`) only needs a host catalog
entry, since the framework runs it through `gettext` when the form
re-renders. See [`i18n.md`](i18n.md#in-code).

## Search, filters, ordering

- `search_fields` — a case-insensitive substring match against these
  fields, OR'd together, driven by the list view's search box.
- `filters` — a sequence of `Filter` objects (`BooleanFilter(name)`,
  `ChoiceFilter(name, choices=[...])`). They render behind a single
  **Filters** button in the list toolbar, which opens a right-hand
  drawer listing every filter vertically — Django admin's filter
  column, in the drawer form Unfold gives it. Each choice is a link
  that toggles one filter while preserving the others, so filtering
  works with JS off, and the trigger carries a count of how many are
  currently applied. One trigger stays one trigger however many filters
  a `ModelAdmin` declares.
- Any column in `list_display` is sortable by clicking its header;
  `?sort=name` / `?sort=-name` for ascending/descending.

All three compose: the query pipeline applies search, then every
active filter, then ordering, then pagination — in that order, every
time, so a query string fully determines what's on screen (and what
an export produces, see [`exports.md`](exports.md)).

`enable_reordering` (default `False`, unlike the `can_*` flags above)
puts a drag handle on the list view's rows via a small vanilla sortable
library (SortableJS, `theme.html`). Unlike everything else on this page,
dragging never persists anywhere — it only reorders the `<tr>` elements
already on the current page, and reverts on the next reload, sort,
search, or page change re-rendering the table from the server's real
order. It's for triaging a list by hand, not for maintaining a stored
position; an application wanting persisted ordering needs its own
position field and its own way of writing to it (there's no framework
hook for this, since it can't presume your schema).

## Relations

A `ForeignKeyField` (or `OneToOneField`) needs a `Relation`: which
target `ModelAdmin` slug it points at and which of the target's fields
to use as the display label. By default it renders as a shadcn Select
(`ui/select.html`) populated from the target's full queryset on the
form, and as a link (if the viewer can see the target resource,
otherwise plain text) on the list/detail views.

Add the field's name to `autocomplete_fields` to switch the form input
to a searchable shadcn/ui Combobox-style combobox instead, backed by
`GET /{slug}/lookup?q=...` — the target's full queryset is never loaded
into the page, only whatever the search matches (up to 20 results) plus
the current selection. Use this for any relation whose target could
grow large, or where dumping the whole list would leak more than the
viewer should see.

A `ManyToManyField` renders as a searchable multi-select
(`ui/multi-select.html`): a Command-style list you can type at, with the
current selection as removable chips — the same job Django admin's
`filter_horizontal` permissions widget does. Its filtering is
client-side, because a many-to-many's options are already in the page in
full; that also means it is *not* the control for a target with
thousands of rows (there is no many-to-many equivalent of
`autocomplete_fields` yet). It posts one value per selection under the
field's own name, exactly as a `<select multiple>` did, so nothing on
the server side changes.

A relation's *reverse* side — showing/managing a child's records from
the parent's own create/detail/edit pages, Django-admin
StackedInline/TabularInline style — is `Inline`. See
[`inlines.md`](inlines.md).

### Id-based and HTTP-backed models

A `ForeignKeyField`'s value is the related **object**, resolved through
`Relation.get_related` (default: the attribute of the same name). A row that
only stores an id -- typical of a model read over HTTP -- can still show a
label and link, without a fetch per row, by returning a small stand-in from
`get_related`, built from data already on the row:

```python
@dataclass
class Ref:
    id: int
    name: str

Relation(
    "employee_id",
    target="employees",
    display_field="name",
    get_related=lambda row: Ref(id=row.employee_id, name=row.employee_name),
)
```

The stand-in only needs the target's primary key and the `display_field`
attribute. Have the backend return the label with the row. This applies to
every place the field's value is read -- list and detail pages, the edit
form's preselected option, inline rows and exports -- and the field's own name
is still the key in the `data` your `create` receives, so an id-based row can
name the field after its id column (`employee_id`) and read `data["employee_id"]`.

## Actions

An action is a `ModelAdmin` method decorated with `@action`. Record actions
(the detail page) and bulk actions (the list view's row-selection) share one
shape:

```python
from collections.abc import Sequence

from polyadmin.core.action import action
from polyadmin.core.auth import Principal

class UserAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    @action(label="Deactivate", confirm="Deactivate the selected users?")
    def deactivate(self, objects: Sequence[User], principal: Principal | None) -> str | None:
        for obj in objects:
            obj.is_active = False
        return f"Deactivated {len(objects)} user(s)."  # flash message text
```

The method is always called with a list of objects — one for a detail-page
record action, as many as were checked for a bulk action — so it never
needs to know which UI entry point invoked it. The method's name is the
action's name. On the list view, picking one from the bulk-actions listbox
runs it immediately — there's no separate "Apply" step. `confirm=` shows a
shadcn/ui Dialog before the request goes out; `permission=` checks an extra
`{slug}.{permission}` permission (see [`permissions.md`](permissions.md))
beyond the resource's own `.view`; `label=` defaults to the method name,
title-cased. The return value (a string, or `None`) becomes the success
toast text, falling back to `"{label} applied to N record(s)."` when empty.

`@action` works bare (`@action`) or with options. The options are
keyword-only: `label=`, `confirm=`, `permission=` and `where=`.

A method may also be `async def` -- useful for one that calls out to an
async client, such as pushing the selected records to an external system.
The adapter awaits it when it is one.

Actions are collected in the order they are defined, base classes first. A
subclass that overrides an action method **without** decorating it again
keeps the base's label, confirm text, permission and placement and only
changes what it does; decorating it again replaces all of those options.

The built-in **`delete_selected`** is an action too, defined on `ModelAdmin`
and always listed last. Override the method to change the deletion; repeat
`@action(...)` on the override to change its label or confirm text (and
repeat `permission="delete"` if you still want that check). It is the one
exception to the Dialog: on a ModelAdmin that implements `delete_preview`
it opens a server-rendered confirmation page instead, listing the selected
records and what deleting them takes with it — see
[`deletes.md`](deletes.md). That applies to an override of your own too:
the page is keyed on the name.

### Where an action appears

`where=` places an action: `"list"` (the bulk bar only), `"detail"` (one
record's page only) or `"both"`, the default. A ModelAdmin can also set
`detail_actions`, an ordered list of action names that **replaces** the
`where` default for its detail page:

```python
class UserAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    detail_actions = ["deactivate", "export_badge"]  # [] offers none

    @action
    def activate(self, objects: Sequence[User], principal: Principal | None) -> str | None: ...

    @action
    def deactivate(self, objects: Sequence[User], principal: Principal | None) -> str | None: ...

    @action(where="detail")
    def export_badge(self, objects: Sequence[User], principal: Principal | None) -> str | None: ...
```

Naming an action that `where="list"` would hide is fine: the explicit
list wins. A name that matches no action fails when the `Admin` is
built. `detail_actions` only decides which buttons the detail page shows;
the list page is unaffected.

The built-in `delete_selected` is bulk-only. It never appears on a detail
page, even when named in `detail_actions` or overridden. It is removed
entirely by `disable_delete_selected = True` or `can_delete = False`,
however it is defined.

Placement is not authorization: hiding a button does not stop a request
to `POST /{slug}/actions/{name}`. Restrict who may run an action with
`permission=`.

### Migrating from `Action(...)`

Earlier versions declared actions as a list of `Action` objects wrapping
free functions:

```python
def deactivate(model_admin, objects, principal): ...

class UserAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    actions = [Action("deactivate", deactivate, confirm="Sure?")]
```

That form is gone, and a ModelAdmin that still sets `actions` raises a
`TypeError` when the class is defined. Move each function into the class as
a method, drop the `model_admin` parameter (it is `self` now), and pass the
old `Action(...)` options to `@action(...)`. The action's name is now the
method's name.

## Save as new

`save_as` adds a second submit to the edit form. It saves the
submitted values as a **new** record and leaves the one being edited
untouched -- Django's `save_as`:

```python
class OrganizationAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    save_as = True
```

It validates exactly as an update would, needs the principal's create
permission, and lands on the new record. Inline children are **not**
copied: they still point at the original, and duplicating a dozen of
them silently would be a surprise.

## Prepopulated fields

Fill one field from others as they are typed -- a slug from a title:

```python
class ArticleAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    prepopulated_fields = {"slug": ["title"]}
    # Keep the letters as they are instead of transliterating:
    prepopulated_unicode = ["slug"]
```

This runs in the browser, on the **create form only**: once a record
exists its slug is a real identifier, and rewriting it from the title is
how links rot. Typing in the target detaches it for the rest of the
form's life, and a value already there is never overwritten.

Slugs transliterate to ASCII by default -- `Café du Coin` becomes
`cafe-du-coin`, `Привет мир` becomes `privet-mir` -- which is what
`polyadmin.core.slug.slugify` does server-side, so a script and the
browser agree. Letters outside the transliteration table drop out, which
is what `prepopulated_unicode` (and `slugify_unicode`) is for.

Nothing is slugified on the server and uniqueness is not checked: this
is a convenience, not a constraint.

## Templates

`list_template`/`detail_template`/`form_template`/`delete_template` name
an explicit template for one view. See
[`templates.md`](templates.md) for the full override resolution order.
